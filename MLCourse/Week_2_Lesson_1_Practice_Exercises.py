"""Problem Set 1: Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis"""
"""Problem 1.1: Conceptual Understanding"""
"""
    You're building a model to predict house prices. For each scenario below,
    identify whether the model likely suffers from high bias, high variance, or
    is well-balanced. Explain your reasoning.

    a) A linear regression model that consistently underpredicts expensive homes
        and overpredicts cheap homes across all neighborhoods
    b) A decision tree model that achieves 98% accuracy on training data but
        only 65% on test data
    c) A k-NN model with k=1 that gives wildly different predictions when you
        add or remove a single training example
    d) A polynomial regression of degree 15 trained on 20 data points
    e) A simple linear regression that achieves similar performance on both
        training and test sets, but the predictions seem to miss important
        non-linear patterns"""

# a) Most likely high bias. High bias tends to cause underfitting, which is
#   consistently making the same errors. The model is failing to capture
#   more complex, underlying issues in the data. The housing market is more
#   complex than can be represented by a linear regression model.
# b) This is high variance. We see a classic example of overfitting, where we
#   have made the training error very low, but the test data error is much 
#   higher.
# c) Most likely high variance. The description is classic overfitting.
# d) This is also high variance/overfitting. The model will hit the 20 data
#   points but be unable to adapt to anything else.
# e) This example is high bias/underfitting. The model is not complex enough and
#   therefore obligatorily misses non-linear patterns consistently.

"""Problem 1.2: Model Complexity Analysis"""
"""
    Given the following learning curves (training error vs. model complexity),

    (1 to 20) on a dataset with 1000 samples.

    b) Explain the bias-variance characteristics at degrees 1, 6, and 20
    c) What would you expect to happen with degree 25?
"""

# a) Degree 6 seems to be the optimal degree, because it minimizes test error.
#   as a bonus, it also minimizes total error..
# b) Degrees 1 and 3 underfit, degrees 10, 15, and 20 are overfit. The underfit
#   is most apparent in 1 and 3 because the model recreates its error in the
#   training and in the test. The overfit is apparent from 10-20 as ever smaller
#   changes in the training error are met by high variance and increasing test
#   error with smaller changes in training error.
# c) I would expect that degree 25 would be far too overfit.

"""

# a) Clearly Time Series Cross-Validation. Train on the past, predict the
#   future.
# b) Stratified k-fold would be good here. We have an imbalanced data set so
#   stratified cross-validation is critical.
# c) LOOCV is probably best due to the limited sample size, however it may also
#   result in high variance, which is undesirable. However, we need a method

# d) Time Series Cross-Validation, again for obvious reasons.
# e) k-fold Cross-Validation. We have a lot of data to process and we shouldn't

    e) What statistical test would you use to determine if one model

"""

# a) Because time is not a feature here, we are not going to use Time Series CV.
#   20% is not particularly imbalanced, so Stratified or Regular k-fold seem
#   more appealing than LOOCV (not to mention n=8000). I would use stratified
#   k-fold here because it's not as balanced as I would like in order to use
#   k-fold. I would select k-10 because it is standard, and then I'd consider
#   attempting the evaluation with other k values to see if we can get any
#   improvements, time and computational resources allowing.
# b) The evaluation metric is binary. When training the model, we will attempt
#   to fit the features to either True or False depending on if we have retained
#   (True) or lost (False) the customer. The primary metric will be the F1-Score
#   due to its robustness to imbalance. We will also use Precision and Recall
#   for more complete analysis. We could also use AUC-ROC due to its robustness
#   to imbalance.
# c) I will handle class imbalance by using stratified k-fold CV, as explained
#   in my selection evaluation. We will apply weight to classes with more churn
#   because our primary goal is to prevent losing customers. This way we can
#   assign a heavy penalty to missing a churner, to reinforce catching churn in
#   the model. Catching customers who are predicted to churn but don't are far
#   less critical in our metrics.
# d) 1. Data split. Divide the 8000 customers into training sets (e.g. 80% of
#   the customers) and a test set.
#    2. Preprocessing. How will we handle missing values? How will we encode
#       categorical features? How will we scale numerical features?
#    3. Cross-validation setup according to a). In our case, k=10 for stratified
#       CV. For each fold, use 9 training folds and 1 validation fold to score
#       the training.
#    4. Model training and hyperparameter tuning. Both logistic and random
#       forest models require hyperparameter tuning useing the CV setup.
#    5. Model comparison. Compare the best-validated F1-scores of the best
#       logistic regression and best random forest models. Perform statistical
#       analysis (see part e)
#    6. Final evaluation. Train the final chosen model on the entire training
#       set. Evaluate its performance on the held-out test set.
# e) I would use a standard hypothesis p-value test. Our null hypothesis is that
#   the performance metrics should not be different between the models. We would
#   have k F1-scores for both the logistic and random forest models that we
#   would expect to be the same if the models are equally performant.
#   We would perform a paired t-test on each of the two groups to yield a

"""

# a) Because we are relying on R^2 as our evaluation metric, lambda = 10 is the

# b) Lambda = 0 is an overfit. We are using all coefficients, have high R^2 for
#   our training data, but a poor fit for our test data. At lambda = 1000, we
#   are underfit. We see a similar R^2 value for both, meaning that the "error"
#   in training is being repeated in test. We are also only using 3
#   coefficients.
# c) I would expect L2 regularization to exacerbate underfit/overfit issues by
#   making the penalty worse for overfitting/underfitting. However, this may be
#   useful as a followup if we focus our computations around lambda = 10, to try
#   to find better lambda values.
# d) I would look for lambda [10, 100]. We see that for lambda = 10 we have 45
#   coefficients and for lambda = 100 we have 12. Presumably it is somewhere
#   between those two where we can get 20 coefficients. I would start at about

# a) L1. We have high dimensionality where most features are irrelevant.

"""

# a) The goal is to quantify engagement patterns:
#   * Number of pages visited normalized by total session length
#   * Average time spent on the site by user
#   * Device type (computer and mobile broken down into Android, iPhone, or
#       other)
# b) The goal is to quantify temporal effects:
#   * Time of day
#   * Day of week
#   * Day of month if our e-commerce site has month-specific patterns
#   * Month of year
#   * Season
#   * Relationship to holidays, depending on what we sell
#   * Temperature data, if our e-commerce site sells seasonal items, such as
#       bathing suits or winter clothes or if it sells items that are generally
#       consumed cold.
# c) The goal is to quantify interaction terms:
#   * Time on site + device type (is our website experience poor on mobile?)
#   * Time on site before previous purchase (how long did they browse? did
#       they make a quick purchase or research one, then buy?)
#   * Time between previous purchases (how often do they buy from us?)
#   * Device type and demographics (what types of users use which devices?)
#   * Location and temperature data (if we sell a seasonal item)
#   * Time of day and device type (to see if people browse on their phones
#       during the day and on their home PCs in the evenings)
#   * Previous purchases and account age (how are we retaining customers?)
#   * Honestly, there are so many of these that could be related. I tried to
#       list a handful here to get the picture, but it's going to boil down to
#       what we sell, our target markets, etc.
# d) Temporal data will generally be cyclical, so trigonometric features should
#       be used to encode it before the model. Time spent on site may have
#       diminishing or increasing returns, so polynomial may be good and we can
#       make it positive or negative exponent to represent increasing returns
#       or diminishing returns, depending on the trends we see. We could also
#       see nonlinear relationships with the combination of account age and
#       purchase history. Long-term customers may be much more likely to be
#       repeat customers. We could also see non-cyclical, non-linear effects
#       near holidays and seasons that correspond to our sold products.
# e) To handle missing data, I would use non-zero dummy values. E.g., when
#       looking at day of the week a purchase was made, if the data isn't
#       available for some reason, I'd consider using either 8, because there
#       is no 8th day of the week, or -1. I'd avoid 0 because of multiplication
#       division errors that will almost certainly occur. This method should
#       be generalizable. E.g., if we track 3 devices, device #4 is unknown.
#       13th month in the year, 2500 hours for time, 5th season for season, etc.
#       Then, when we decode data, we decode the nonsense value as "Unknown" and
#       that can help inform our data collection going forwards. Alternatively,
#       if our model cannot handle nonsense data, we could use a different
#       encoding method such as one-hot.

# a) I would use Chi-Square tests and Correlation Values. Chi-Square tests are
#       good for large sample sizes. Chi-Square tests will also help us
#       understand which features are most informative to the model. Correlation
#       values will be useful because the target is binary. We should be able to
#       capture linear relationships. If we do not expect linear information,
#       I would use Mutual Information to extract information that is shared
#       between features. If any features are well-captured by other features,
#       the redundant features can be eliminated.
# b) I would use recursive feature elimination. We have many features and if we
#       expect that only 50 will be relevant, then RFE will be a good choice.
# c) I would use Elastic Net. Without further information about the data set or
#       model, it would be difficult to select Tree-based feature importance,
#       L1 regression/regularization, or Regularized linear models. Elastic Net
#       is also a good default.
# d) If we are using three or four feature selection methods, I would use Latin
#       hypercube sampling to set up initial hyperparameters for our selection
#       methods. I would use the F1-Score as the final metric because it is
#       well-suited to binary results. I would also consider ROC for the same
#       reason. I would then execute the feature selection methods with each of
#       the hyperparameter vectors established by the LHS. I would use that
#       initial run to find the optimal hyperparameters and perform perturbation
#       analysis around them. ROC would be useful for allowing comparison of
#       classifier discrimination ability independent of the threshold for the
#       binary output.
# e) One method I would use is feature stability analysis. If we create folds
#       of features and see how often the same features are selected on repeat
#       trials, it is likely that those features are well-generalized.
#       I would also use feature ablation testing by selectively removing
#       features from the final selected subset. If removing features results in
#       a performance drop, those features were likely important.

# Goal: predict customer lifetime value
# Data: 50,000 customers; 200 features; missing values
# Purpose: Deploy model to determine marketing budget allocation
# Constraints: Model must be interpretable; Model must update each week


# a) Data splitting strategy. We will use a hybrid temporal holdout with nested
#       folds. The primary split will reserve the most recent 10% of the
#       customer data as a final holdout set to simulate for the future values
#       that we need. The remaining 90% will be used for cross-validation but
#       keeping the folds time-aware.
# b) Cross-Validation Approach. We will use the 90% of data from a) for our CV.
#       We propose an expanding window strategy or sliding window approach. The
#       approach will depend on our data volume, distribution of data, and if
#       we believe that older data is still relevant. For example, if we do not
#       believe that data from 10+ weeks ago is still relevant, we will adopt
#       a sliding window approach so that we do not retrain on older data.
#       The exact number of folds and window sizes will depend on the temporal
#       distribution of the data. If all our data is concentrated in a short
#       time, additional data collection is needed before reliable temporal
#       validation is possible. If we assume that we have about 12 weeks of
#       data, then we can perform an expanding or sliding window approach.
# c) For feature engineering and selection strategy, we must be adaptable to the
#       business context. Because specific features are not indicated, we must
#       use general principles:
#       * Focus on features that are likely correlated with Customer Lifetime
#           value
#       * Domain-Informed Features (e.g., product categories, customer
#           demographics, marketing channels) that are strongly correlated with
#           our goals
#       * Temporal features, including recency, frequency, and monetary metrics
#       * Interaction features betwween behavioral and demographic data
#       * Handling missing data. In this case, I'd likely use median imputation.
#           Presumably, we are mostly collecting data on our target demographic,
#           so the median is likely widely applicable.
#       For selection, given the large feature set, we will use a multi-stage
#           selection process:
#       * Filter Method: Mutual Information for non-linear dependencies. We have
#           a large data set and it is computationally efficient.
#       * Wrapper Method: RFE
#       * Embedded Method: Elastic Net.
# d) Regularization Strategy. Our Elastic Net method works as a regularization
#       technique as well. Elastic Net is functional with our high
#       dimensionality. It also allows feature selection synergy by using this
#       strategy as regularization as well.
# e) Primary and secondary evaluation metrics. Because the objective is to
#       optimize marketing budget by using the predicted CLV, our evaluation
#       must capture model accuracy and budgeting impact.
#       Our primary metric is MAE of the CLV predictions.
#       Our secondary metrics are R^2, MSE, and the Budget Efficiency Ratio
#       (which will be employed in post-deployment monitoring). This is defined
#       as the change in predicted CLV divided by the change in marketing
#       budget, tracked over time.
# f) Statistical Significance Testing. To ensure our model is accurate, and that
#       said accuracy is not produced by random change, we will employ
#       multiple statistic tests. We will use Paired Sample Tets on prediction
#       errors. Using a paired t-test, we can test whether the mean error
#       difference is statistically significant when compared to a baseline
#       value, such as historic means. We will compare performance metrics
#       across cross-validation folds as well.
# g) Our model monitoring plan is to conduct training week-by-week (see b) to
#       produce the next week's marketing budget and forecasted CLVs in
#       accordance with the problem statement. This will also be used to retrain
#       or update the model with the most recent data. We will be looking
#       closely at feature distribution drift using statistical tests to see if
#       we are experiencing shifts in input data that may affect the reliability
#       of our model. We will also track the Budget Efficiency Ratio on a weekly
#       basis to provide a practical measure of how well the model is enabling
#       marketing to allocate resources.

"""Problem 6.2"""
"""
    You've built a model with the following characteristics:

    High training accuracy (95%)
    Low test accuracy (70%)
    Large difference between CV scores across folds (65%-85%)
    Feature importances change dramatically with small data changes

    Diagnose the issues and propose solutions:
    a) What problems do you identify?
    b) Which theoretical concepts explain these symptoms?
    c) Propose a systematic approach to address each issue
    d) How would you validate that your solutions work?
"""

# a) I identified the three problems given in the problem statement. 1. Low test
#       accuracy. 2. Poor CV scores. 3. Small changes in the data causes feature
#       importance evaluations to change significantly.
# b) Low test accuracy means we have a fundamental disconnect between our
#       training of the model and the testing of the model. There are many
#       reasons this could occur, however one of the primary reasons could be
#       that our training data is poorly correlated with our test data. For
#       eample, we may have a poor feature binning method that has created
#       training folds that are fundamentally different from our test folds.
#       The Poor CV scores could be caused by a similar issue. If we are cross-
#       validating with poorly-binned folds, then we will have poor cross-
#       validation. In fact, this would also explain why feature importance
#       changes dramatically with small data changes. The model cannot
#       determine which features are actually important, and is therefore unable
#       to satisfactorily eliminate features.
#       It is also possible that there is an issue with our use of a filter,
#       CV method, or regularization method.
# c) I would begin by restarting the cross-validation method. I would split
#       our data again and perform cross-validation with different fold sizes.
#       I would then perform statistical similarity tests with the results. We
#       would expect that the results should be fairly consistent for well-
#       binned folds.
#       If our CV method does not appear to be the issue, I would revisit our
#       filter method. I'd consider using no filter method or changing our
#       filter method (e.g. Chi-square to Mutual Information) to see what
#       changes.
#       If reevaluation of our filter method does not improve performance, I
#       would look at our Regularization methodology. The overfitting of feature
#       importance suggests that we may have a poor regularization method (
#       because regularization is supposed to help prevent overfitting). I would
#       try a different method. E.g., if we are using Elastic Net, try just L1
#       or L2.
#       If  that doesn't work, I would revisit our Wrapper method. I'd
#       leave this one for last due to the computational expense, but changing
#       the method to see how it affects our results can be informative.
# d) I would validate that my solutions work by using statistical similarity
#       tests (e.g. paired t-test) to ensure that my results are less likely
#       to have been generated by random chance instead of by an actual
#       improvement to the model.
