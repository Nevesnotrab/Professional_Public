Personal work to use to show my skills (or lack thereof).

I am currently an MS student in Chemical Engineering. No further information will be provided publicly.

These files consist of personal projects that showcase my skills. .py files should be ready to go, but you might have to download additional libraries.

Programs that should not work on their own are labeled as unfinished. If it is unfinished then you are on your own.
Programs that should work on their own are simply labeled with the name of the file. This doesn't mean that they have completed functionality, however.
    For example, the genetic algorithm code is not super awesome. It works, but some of the verbosity functionality is still missing.

If you found this from my resume, feel free to contact me from the email on my resume.
If you found this some other way I would prefer not to be contacted without good reason, but if you have one (like a job offer) then email nevesnotrab@gmail.com
